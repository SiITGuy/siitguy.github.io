        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>IT Engineer / Developer in South Wales, UK. I've been working in IT for over 10 years!</p> 
        <p>Currently I am working in the enterprise IT environment managing end user device builds and policies. Specialising in Jamf & Intune architecture and support across local authority and educational organisations</p>
        <p>Also starting in 2019 I started working as a PHP / Wordpress developer, creating several bespoke plugins and themes for SME sector. Website development is something I really enjoyed in my studies in college so was very excited to do this for several years following my years in IT Support </p>
